This is a dirty proof of concept to demonstrate how to hide Apple's system Apps on iOS.
(At least until you reboot your iDevice or until Apple fixes this bug).

# Installation

Currently my personal URL is hardcoded in the index.html and the plist-files.
So prior to use this Webapp, do a search on these files and replace the URL with your own URL.
(If you are able to contribute a more sophisticated solution, don't hesitate to fork and improve it!)
Upload all files to your URL and open it with Mobile Safari.

# Usage

1. Tap on the app you want to hide and install the "Delete me!"-App. You'll notice that the install process will fail intentionally).
2. Tap and hold the "Delete me!"-App and (guess what) delete the app.
3. Success!

Kudos to David Gölzhäuser for his HiddenApp (removed from the AppStore) and his Webapp available here: http://idoodler.de/hideapps.html
